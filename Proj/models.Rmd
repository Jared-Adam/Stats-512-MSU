## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
 
Theoretical model:

${Predation|Treatment,GrowthStage} \sim \beta_0 + \beta_1I_{Treatment = 2}_i +  \beta_2I_{Treatment = 3}_i + \beta_3I_{Treatment = 4}_i + \beta_4I_{GrowthStage = V5}_i + \beta_5I_{GrowthStage = V3}_i + \Year_i + \Location_i + \Block_i + \Plot_i + \Error_i$

Add the appropriate stuff below

$\pi\{Predation|Treatment, GrowthStage} \sim \beta_0 + \beta_1I_{Treatment = 2} + \beta_2I_{Treatment = 3} + \beta_3I_{Treatment = 4} + \beta_4I_{GrowthStage = V5} + \beta_5I_{GrowthStage = V3}$
