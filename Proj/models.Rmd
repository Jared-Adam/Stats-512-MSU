Theoretical model:

${Predation|Treatment,GrowthStage} \sim \beta_0 + \beta_1I_{Treatment = 2}_i +  \beta_2I_{Treatment = 3}_i + \beta_3I_{Treatment = 4}_i + \beta_4I_{GrowthStage = V5}_i + \beta_5I_{GrowthStage = V3}_i$

$\Year_i + \Location_i + \Block_i + \Plot_i + \Error_i$

Add the appropriate stuff below

${Predation|Treatment, GrowthStage} \sim \beta_0 + \beta_1I_{Treatment = 2} + \beta_2I_{Treatment = 4} + \beta_3I_{Treatment = 3} + \beta_4I_{GrowthStage = V5} + \beta_5I_{GrowthStage = V3}$
