## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

This is for the review from chapter 1

```{r}
library(readr)
```

data

```{r}
treadmill <- read_csv('http://www.math.montana.edu/courses/s217/documents/treadmill.csv')
treadmill
```

downloading his package

```{r}
library(remotes)
remotes::install_github('greenwood-stat/catstats2')
```

```{r}
library(catstats2)
data(treadmill)

library(mosaic)
```

explore with this package \####

```{r}
data <- treadmill
```

summary stats

```{r}
favstats(data$RunTime)
```

visuals

```{r}
hist(data$RunTime)
hist(data$RunTime, labels = T)
```

outlier? the standard for base R boxplot is that an outlier is 1.5 times greater than the IQR (inter-quartile range) IQR = Q3 - Q1

```{r}
IQR <- 11.27 - 9.78
IQR

11.27 + 1.5*IQR
```

it appears that the max of 14.03 is an outlier

```{r}
boxplot(data$RunTime,
        ylab  = '1.5 Mile Run Time (minutes)',
        main = 'Boxplot of run times of n=31')
```
